# Week Task Challenge

The goal of this task is to create a 7-day task calendar where each day can have between 0 and 7 tasks. When loading the data, tasks are fetched from the back-end. This task allows navigating forward or backward by days while maintaining the correct number of days based on the database. Additionally, the number of tasks for each day should be displayed within the corresponding column of the table.
